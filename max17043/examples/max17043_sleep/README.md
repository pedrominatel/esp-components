# MAX17043 Sleep/Wake Example

This example demonstrates power management features including sleep mode, wake-up, and quick start calibration.

## Description

This example will:
1. Read initial battery voltage and SOC
2. Put the MAX17043 into sleep mode (ultra-low power)
3. Wait for 5 seconds in sleep mode
4. Wake the device
5. Read battery data after waking
6. Perform a quick start calibration for accurate SOC reading
7. Display final values

This demonstrates how to reduce power consumption during idle periods.
